#### _A website that is designed to allow the user to input a word, phrase or sentence. The website then returns the user's input with all of the vowels removed_

#### By **Patrick Wells**


## Description

This website is designed around the concept of a word game in which one player picks a word and a second player guesses what the word is. This functionality is brought about when player 1 inputs a word, phrase or sentence into the input field that is located on the homepage of the website.

Once player 1 submits the form via a button, the vowels are removed from the string and it is outputted on a subsequent results pages. The places that the vowels previously inhabited are replaced with dashes. Player 2 can then begin to guess the word. If player 2 is unable to guess the word, they can click on one of the boxes that contains a dash in order to reveal that word.

Once all of the dashed boxes have been filled the word is complete and the game is over.
